LITERALLY EVERY LINE OF CODE WITHIN THE 'simple' FOLDER WAS NOT WRITTEN BY ME!! EVERY SINGLE ONE!
IT IS ALL FANG YIDONG'S WORK!

Originally, I just used the actual jar file for json simple because there is literally no native functionality for json in Java.
But, I came across a line in the project brief that said you can't use external jars.
However, you are allowed to use other people's code so long as you credit them so that you aren't marked for it.

!!!(EVERYTHING IN THE 'simple' FOLDER IS NOT MY CODE, DO NOT MARK ME FOR IT!!!!!!!!!)!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

So, I totally just stole the entire library.
A technicality, maybe, but there just isn't a way to work with JSONs natively on Java.
Hopefully, it was an unnecessary precaution.

Final Note:
I DID NOT WRITE ANYTHING IN THE 'simple' FOLDER SERIOUSLY. I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING ABOUT PLAGIARISM.
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.
I DIDN'T WRITE ANY OF THE 'simple' FOLDER. IT IS ALL THE 'jsonsimple' LIBRARY WRITTEN BY FANG YIDONG.
